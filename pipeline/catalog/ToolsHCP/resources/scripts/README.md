hcp-xnat-pipeline-customizations
================================

pipeline/catalog/ToolsHCP/resources/scripts directory

Many of the files in this directory are not used by the pipelines in the sense that a pipeline invokes 
one of the scripts but are instead used to launch pipelines.

They are generally "deployed" in the hcpexternal account's home directory (<code>/data/hcpdb/home</code>) in the 

<code>HCP_PYTHON/db_pipeline_customizations/templates/misc/catalog/ToolsHCP/resources/scripts</code> 

subdirectory.
